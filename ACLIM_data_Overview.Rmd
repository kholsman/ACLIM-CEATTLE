# Permission for data use:

## General ACLIM guidance for authorship and data use:

We encourage inclusivity in co-authorship but it is important to identify criteria for co-authors, especially detail roles for each paper, and as such please provide ample time and opportunity for people to be involved in your paper if they are interested.
 
If you are coupling your model to the ACLIM projections and/or ATTACH() function please consider the following approach:

1. The first time a coupling is used, we highly encourage you to invite as co-authors:
    + ROMSNPZ: Al Hermann and Wei Cheng (ROMS) and Kelly Kearney and Kerim Aydin (NPZ and 2017 hindcast)
    + ATTACH: Amanda Faig and Alan Haynie

2. Subsequent papers, consider invitation if there is advancements in methods or additional analyses in the coupled approach (or outcomes).

For all papers we suggest inclusivity and broad co-authorship in order to promote synthesis across models and results and to avoid duplicative papers.  As such, here is a list of the ACLIM team and growing list of collaborators:

# Data Access:

## Downloading the data and code:

For most applications you can use the aclim indices available on the shared ACLIM drive:

[**00_ACLIM_shared>01_DATA>2019_May_updated**](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Jn-bX4OuPL6helzXh4arlAmZhMl3Nm6g "00_ACLIM_shared>01_DATA>2019_May_updated") 

Please be sure to coordinate with ROMSNPZ modeling team members to ensure data is applied appropriately. If you need access to the raw ROMSNPZ files (netcdf, non-regridded large files located on MOX). Please contact Dr. Hermann (<albert.j.hermann@noaa.gov>) or Dr. Kerim Aydin (<kerim.aydin@noaa.gov>).

### Step 1: Clone the repo to your local directory:

Select `clone` or downlaod from the upper right hand side of the repo page :[**github.com/kholsman/ACLIM**](https://github.com/kholsman/ACLIM "ACLIM Repo") and save it to your local directory: `~[YOURPATH]/ACLIM`.

![](Figs/clone.jpg){ width=40% }

### Step 2: download data to local directory:

The ACLIM data files include the following four files and should be downloaded from the [**google folder**](https://drive.google.com/drive/u/0/folders/1Jn-bX4OuPL6helzXh4arlAmZhMl3Nm6g "00_ACLIM_shared>01_DATA>2019_May_updated") and copied into the `~[YOURPATH]/ACLIM/Data` folder on your local directory : 

* `ROMS_NPZ.Rdata`
* `ROMSNPZ_output.Rdata`
* `all_stations_meta.Rdata`
* `var_defv2.xlsx` (definitions of each variable in the Rdata files)  

![](Figs/datadir.jpg){ width=40% }


# ACLIM indices in Rdata files:

There are 4 types of ACLIM indices included in these files:

## 1. Summer survey replicated values:  

Survey replicated values (using mean location and sampling date for each groundfish survey station) for the most of the ROMSNPZ output variables have been collated in the ROMSNPZ_output.Rdata file. These need to be regridded to lat lon from the native ROMS grid (Xi Eta) and the `scripts/PLOT_spatial_ROMSNPZ.R`script will step you through doing that and creating the following figures in R (note: resampling stations were removed before creating bottom temperature maps).

![Survey replicated stations](Figs/survey_grid.jpg){ width=40% }

![Survey replicated summer bottom temperature](Figs/survy_rep.jpg){ width=60% }

## 2. Weekly - strata-specific timeseries:  

We also ran weekly queries for the 6 major strata in the SEBS and those indices provide timeseries of 

## 2. Monthly - strata-specific timeseries:  

## 4. Annual indices (e.g., Spring Zoop., Cold pool area, etc.):

![Shiny web tool](Figs/shiny.jpg){ width=60% }

The annual indices can be previewed with this interactive graphic at [**kholsman.shinyapps.io/aclim**](https://kholsman.shinyapps.io/aclim/ "ACLIM Shiny tool"). These annual indices are located in the [TBA directory] and can be explored using this vingnette `TBA.pdf`.

### Hindcast and Projection Models

[**NOAA's Pacific Marine Environmental Laboratory (PMEL)**](http://www.pmel.noaa.gov/) produced downscaled hindcasts and projections of Bering Sean ocean conditions using boundary conditions from mulitple global climate models (Hermann et al. 2016,2019; Kearney et al.2020):


### CORE-CFSR (1976-2012) 

This is the hindcast for the Bering Sea and is a combination of the reconstructed climatology from the [**CLIVAR**](http://portal.aoos.org/bering-sea.php#module-metadata/5626a0b6-7d79-11e3-ac17-00219bfe5678/0756e6c2-a8e2-40af-aa3d-22051ed68067) Co-ordinated Ocean-Ice Reference Experiments (CORE) Climate Model (1969-2006) the [**NCEP**](http://portal.aoos.org/bering-sea.php#module-metadata/f8cb79f6-7d59-11e3-a6ee-00219bfe5678/2deb2eca-f3f5-4eda-a132-112468711de7) Climate Forecast System Reanalysis is a set of re-forecasts carried out by NOAA's National Center for Environmental Prediction (NCEP). See [**CFS-R**](http://cfs.ncep.noaa.gov/cfsr/) for more info.

### [CCCMA](http://www.cccma.ec.gc.ca/diagnostics/cgcm3/cgcm3.shtml)(2006-2039; AR4 SRES A1B) 

Developed by the Canadian Centre for Climate Modelling and Analysis, this is also known as the CGCM3/T47 model. This model showed the greatest warming over time compared to other models tested by PMEL. See more data the [**AOOS:CCCMA portal**](http://portal.aoos.org/bering-sea.php#module-metadata/4f706756-7d57-11e3-bce5-00219bfe5678/ffa1bcc1-288d-4f8e-912e-500a618b241a).

### [ECHOG](http://www-pcmdi.llnl.gov/ipcc/model_documentation/ECHO-G.pdf)(2006-2039; AR4 SRES A1B)
The ECHO-G model from the Max Planck Institute in Germany This model showed the least warming over time compared to other models tested by PMEL. See more data the <a href="http://portal.aoos.org/bering-sea.php#module-metadata/18ffa59c-7d7a-11e3-82a4-00219bfe5678/f2e5592b-28d2-483d-8ef8-52aa18f6e3dc">AOOS:ECHO-G portal</a>.

### [GFDL](http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov/earth-system-model) (2006-2100; AR5 RCP 4.5, 8.5, SSP126,SSP585) 

The NOAA Geophysical Fluid Dynamics Laboratory [**GFDL**](http://www.gfdl.noaa.gov) has lead development of the first Earth System Models (ESMs), which like physical climate models, are based on an atmospheric circulation model coupled with an oceanic circulation model, with representations of land, sea ice and iceberg dynamics; ESMs additionally incorporate interactive biogeochemistry, including the carbon cycle. The ESM2M model used in this project is an evolution of the prototype EMS2.1 model, where pressure-based vertical coordinates are used along the developmental path of GFDL's Modular Ocean Model version 4.1 and where the land model is more adavanced (LM3) than in the previous ESM2.1

### [MIROC](www.cger.nies.go.jp/publications/report/i073/I073.pdf)(2006-2039; AR4 SRES A1B; 2006-2100 RCP4.5, RCP8.5, SSP585, SSP126) 

The Model for Interdisciplinary Research on Climate (MIROC)-M model developed by a <a href="www.cger.nies.go.jp">consortium of agencies in Japan</a> []. Compared to other models tested by PMEL, MIROC-M was intermediate in degree of warming over the Bering Sea shelf for the first half of the 21st century. See more data the <a href="http://portal.aoos.org/bering-sea.php#module-metadata/68ea728a-7d7a-11e3-823b-00219bfe5678/bb0d0b5e-878f-4ebb-8985-0d0e6aefe71f">AOOS:MIROC portal</a>.


### ACLIM_data & ACLIM_scripts
  
This folder contains the most recent queries from the BEAST based on the scripts in [ACLIM_scripts]("https://github.com/kholsman/ACLIM/ACLIM_scripts"). The queries create annual indices (e.g., mean summer bottom temperature for the EBS survey area) which are station specific(Station_modelname) and based on the mean sampling date for each station, or based on weekly values (under folder [weekly]("https://github.com/kholsman/ACLIM/ACLIM_data/ROMS_NPZ_queries/weekly"); are "clipped to the survey area").
These indices were cleaned and aggregated in the .Rdata file `ROMSNPZ_indices.Rdata` using the script `createROMSNPZ.R`.
